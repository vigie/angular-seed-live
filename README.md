angular-seed-live
===

Use this seed to get an angular application up and running in
the minimum amount of time as possible.

All typescript transpiliation and Angular compilation happens in
the browser, so this seed should only be used for small demos and
prototypes only.

This seed is a suitable starting point for applications hosted in
codepen, plunkr or other online editors.
